  "\"Diagram\" selected sentence": {
    "prompt": "Below I will provide you with a string of text. Your job is to produce a JSON representation of its sentence structure. \n\n1. Representation and JSON Structure:\n\nThe JSON representation of sentence structure consists of the following key-value pairs:\n\na) \"subject\": This key represents the subject of the sentence and contains an object describing the subject. The subject object can include properties such as \"type\" (to specify the type of subject, e.g., noun or pronoun) and \"value\" (to store the actual subject word or phrase).\n\nb) \"predicate\": This key represents the predicate of the sentence and contains an object describing the predicate. The predicate object can include properties such as \"type\" (to specify the type of predicate, e.g., verb or verb phrase) and \"value\" (to store the actual predicate word or phrase).\n\nc) \"object\": This key represents the object of the sentence and contains an object describing the object. The object object can include properties such as \"type\" (to specify the type of object, e.g., noun or pronoun) and \"value\" (to store the actual object word or phrase).\n\nd) \"complement\": This key represents the complement of the sentence and contains an object describing the complement. The complement object can include properties such as \"type\" (to specify the type of complement, e.g., adjective or noun phrase) and \"value\" (to store the actual complement word or phrase).\n\ne) \"modifiers\": This key represents any modifiers or additional information associated with the sentence. It contains an array of objects, where each object describes a specific modifier. Each modifier object can include properties such as \"type\" (to specify the type of modifier, e.g., adverbial or prepositional phrase) and \"value\" (to store the actual modifier word or phrase).\n\n2. Example JSON Structure:\n\n{\n  \"subject\": {\n    \"type\": \"noun\",\n    \"value\": \"cat\"\n  },\n  \"predicate\": {\n    \"type\": \"verb\",\n    \"value\": \"jumped\"\n  },\n  \"object\": {\n    \"type\": \"noun\",\n    \"value\": \"fence\"\n  },\n  \"complement\": {\n    \"type\": \"adjective\",\n    \"value\": \"high\"\n  },\n  \"modifiers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"adverbial\",\n      \"value\": \"quickly\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"prepositional phrase\",\n      \"value\": \"over the wall\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIn this example, the JSON structure represents a sentence where the subject is \"cat,\" the predicate is \"jumped,\" the object is \"fence,\" the complement is \"high,\" and there are two modifiers: \"quickly\" (an adverbial modifier) and \"over the wall\" (a prepositional phrase modifier). \n\n3. Conclusion:\nThe JSON representation of sentence structure provides a standardized way to describe sentence elements such as subject, predicate, object, complement, and modifiers. It allows for the structured representation of sentence components, making it easier to process and analyze sentence structures programmatically.\n\nNow that I've given you these specifications, your job is to make such an object for the following text string:\n\n{{highlighted}}\n\nNow provide your JSON object:",
